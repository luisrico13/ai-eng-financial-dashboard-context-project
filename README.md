_Financial metrics dashboard with a React + TypeScript frontend and a FastAPI backend._

## Recommended steps

1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Open your fork in GitHub Codespaces or clone it and run it in your local environment.
3. Run your AI agent to inspect both frontend and backend.
4. Document the proposed rules and memory bank in your fork.
5. Refine and validate the rules until they fit the project's real workflow.

## Expected agents directory structure

```text
./.agents
└─ /rules
   └─ <rule-name>.md
└─ /skills
   └─ /<skill-name>
      └─ /SKILL.md
```

Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the applicable
[repository rules](./.agents/rules). Skills are optional; the tree above shows
where to place them if needed.

The [memory bank](./memory-bank/README.md) records the product overview,
technology stack and current state with links to repository evidence.
Suggested next steps are explicitly separate from implemented features.

## How to run locally

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The frontend uses the Vite proxy for `/api` by default, so no extra environment variables are required in local development or Codespaces.
If you need to target a different backend origin, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Verification

From the repository root, with the Compose services running:

```bash
docker compose exec -T frontend npm test -- src/lib/financial-utils.test.ts
docker compose exec -T backend python -m pytest tests/test_routes.py -q
```

Without Compose, run `npm test -- src/lib/financial-utils.test.ts` from
`frontend` and `python -m pytest tests/test_routes.py -q` from `backend`,
with each service's dependencies installed.
Record results in [verification.md](./verification.md).

The dashboard currently fetches `GET /api/metrics` and computes KPIs and monthly
series in the frontend. Other backend endpoints are not yet integrated into the UI.
